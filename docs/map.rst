Using the MAP VIEW
#######################

Like the Search screen, the Map View allows you to view and retrieve records of resources through a spatial depiction.

The search box in the Map View enables you to search for any address within Arches. Depending on the configuration of your installation of Arches-HIP by your system administrator, you may be able to retrieve any address, whether or not there is a record in your database that contains it as an entry (YA: Is this how this point should be phrased?).

You can modify the map display using the following controls:

* Basemaps: The Basemaps button will allow you to select the type of mapping used by Arches. You will be able to select from a number of different map layers that have been configured for your organizationâ€™s installation. By default, the options include three map layers from Bing.
* Overlays: The Overlays button will allow you to toggle the display of different overlay layers that have been configured by your system administrator. A slider will allow you to set the level of opacity for the display of each overlay layer.

The `Arches-HIP Installation Guide`_ contains instructions on configuring Basemaps and Overlays in Arches (check out the "Settings and Customization" section).
