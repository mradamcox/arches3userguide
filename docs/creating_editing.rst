Creating/Editing Resources
###########################

Creating a new resource in Arches-HIP begins with the RESOURCE MANAGER, and only requires that you enter one piece of information about that resource. Just choose which type of resource you want to create, and begin entering information.

To edit an existing resource, click the "EDIT" button which will send you to the RESOURCE MANAGER. The EDIT button can be found in three different places:

1. When a resource is listed in search results
2. At the top right corner of any resource report
3. In the pop-up summary that appears when you click a resource in the MAP VIEW

.. note::
    By default, only users with the appropriate credentials will be able to create and edit data in your installation of Arches. To log in, click on Log In on the top right of any screen and enter your username and password.

Using the RESOURCE MANAGER
==========================

The input forms that you find in the Resource Manager are used both for new resource creation and the modification of existing resources. Each resource type uses a different collection of input forms, and each form collects a different set of information.  Therefore, a "resource" in Arches-HIP is really just an aggregation of attributes that are collected through the forms.

.. note::
    For more detailed information on the default Arches-HIP resource types, `this section <resource_types.html>`_.
